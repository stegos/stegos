//! Internally, ECC point multiplication depends on projective coordinates expressed
//! as 4 components (x, y, z, t), each of which is expressed as 51-bit integer fragments
//! of a 256 bit number. This permits very fast addition/subtraction of field elements,
//! with overflows spilling into the upper bits of each 64-bit fragment. During multiply
//! operations these overflows are reapportioned to higher fragments.
//!
//! Externally the field elements of the coordinates are held as 256 bit bignums in
//! little-endian order, normally expressed as quads of 64-bit unsigned fragments. When
//! necessary, these are forcibly viewed through an "unsafe" transformation to/from 32-bytes.
