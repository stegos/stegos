# Stegos vault

Stegos vault provide api for managing cold storage specific for exchanges.
Stegos vault use the same websocket api like regular stegosd. For more detail read https://docs.stegos.com/developers/websocket_api/.

This api extend https://docs.stegos.com/developers/exchange_integration/  and encapsulate "Output explorer", "Private stegosd node" and " Cold wallet".

The only remaining parts is:
1) Online stegosd node, which should be connected to network, and provide websocket api to some local zone.
2) And stegos-vault, which would operate with online node websocket api, and provide high level api to manage funds.

## Configuration 

Stegos vault will read configuration from one of three location in specific order:
1. From CLI `--config` paramaeter
2. In "currrent" dirrectory : `$PWD/stegosd.toml`
3. From user application data folder: `/home/[USER]/.local/share/stegos-vault/stegos-vault.toml`

Config format is next:

```
node_address = "127.0.0.1:3145"
node_token_path = "/home/[USER]/.local/share/stegos/api.token"

[general]
chain = "testnet"
data_dir = "/home/[USER]/.local/share/stegos-vault"
api_endpoint = "127.0.0.1:4145"
```

`node_address` - is endpoint address of online node.
`node_token_path` - path to online node token.
`chain` - chain history that would be used, can be `testnet` `mainnet` or local `dev`.
`data_dir` - directory to save accounts, operation history and other vault-specific data.
`api_endpoint` - stegos-vault api listen address.
